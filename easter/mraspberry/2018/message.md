## The Reason For Hope

# ME
In my teenage years I walked away from my childhood christian faith.
I walked away because I had questions that I didn't feel I could ask.
I walked away because I had doubts that a carpenter from Nazareth could
really be the Son Of God. I walked away because I had doubts that his death
on a cross was really relevant to me and my life. And I mean, have you ever read
his teachings? Most of them made no sense to me, heck a lot of them still don't. They
didn't tell me anything about how to survive high school, how to get a girlfriend,
how to set myself up to get a good job in the future, nothing that was on my mind
was answered by Him, was it?

Maybe you're like me. Maybe you too were raised in a Christian home but at some point
you realized you couldn't reconcile the Jesus you were told about with what was
going on in your life and the worlld. You couldn't see how a 2,000 year old carpenter could matter
in the 21st century. And after all, who really knows what happened all that time ago? It's
not like any of us were alive to see him for ourselves. Perhaps you even brought that up
to your family or your pastor, and you got an answer that wasn't an answer. Someone just told you
to have faith, but faith in what?

That's where I was from my early teenage years until age 27. At 27 I willingly walked into a church
for the first time in 15 years and I found people who were willing to walk with me while I searched
for the truth of who Jesus was, and if he really did rise from the dead. I read books, listened to
countless sermons, prayed, and finally came to realize that Jesus is who he claimed to be. I learned
that there is a foundation for faith in Jesus, and it's rooted in HISTORY. Jesus really did live, he
really was crucified by Pontius Pilate as the New Testament claims, and there is strong evidence to
support that he really did rise from the dead, proving that He is the unique Son of God, and the final sacrifice
for us. I'd like to go over a small amount of that evidence now.

# GOD
We know Jesus lived and died thanks to the testimony of a Roman historian you've probably heard of
named Tacitus. Tacitus lived from the year 56 AD and during his life documented much of the history
of that time period. While discussing the six day Great Fire of Rome in his *Annals*, he penned the following:

`Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite
tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus,
from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius
at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus`

So from this, we know there were Christians in Rome at the time of the Great Fire of Rome, July 64 AD,
and that they had been there long enough to be hated by the populace. As such, they made a convenient
scapegoat for Emperor Nero to blame the burning of Rome on. But this passage also proves that the New Testament
narrative of the death of Jesus is true (the Romans thought Christ was the last name of Jesus).

So now that we've proved Jesus lived and died as described in the New Testament, let's look at the ressurection.
For that, we can look at a famous follower of Jesus from the first century. No reputable scholar doubts he existed,
and because of the position he occupied in the early church, we know a great deal about his life, His name is Peter,
if you come from a Catholic background you know him as Saint Peter, and his life and death has been meticulously
catalouged for us, let us see if we find in his life evidence to suppot the claims he made about Jesus.

If you've spent time in any church you probably know that after the resurrection Peter
became the leader of the movement Jesus started that we call the Church. You also know I'm sure that Peter was one of
Jesus' closest followers prior to his death, and that when Jesus died Peter denied he even KNEW Jesus. Before the
crucifiction, Peter was also considered the spokesman for the followers of Jesus. In my opinion this is due mostly
to the fact that Peter always seemed to be talking. If you read the New Testament accounts of the life of Jesus
it becomes quickly apparent that if Peter had a thought it was coming out of his mouth immediately.
 He was there for all of the teachings of Jesus, he witnessed Jesus heal his mother, and immediately prior to the arrest of Jesus
Peter even claimed he would die for him.
Of course, after the arrest of Jesus Peter was so scared he wouldn't even admit that he knew him, much less that he
was willing to die for him. But, a few weeks after the death of Jesus, Peter was apparently no longer afraid of anything.
He was more than willing to claim not only that he knew Jesus before his death, but that he had SEEN him since he died.
He boldly proclaimed to anyone he could that Jesus was risen. We see this in what we call the book of Acts, but what is
basically a travel journal of a first century doctor named Luke. The journal was written by 67 AD after Luke interviewed
hundreds of eye witnesses to the events of the life of the carpenter turned itinerant Rabbi from Nazareth (since they were
all mostly still alive). Let's see what Luke documented about the change in Peter and his claims about Jesus:

`Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works
and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know - this Jesus, delivered up
according to the definite plan and forknowledge of God, you crucifed and killed by the hands of lawless men.
God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it - Acts 2:22-24 ESV`

So we see Peter's first ever sermon documented here, he was talking to people who, just a few weeks earlier, had
screamed at Pilate for Jesus to be crucified. And not only did Peter remind them of that, he claimed God planned
it that way all along. What happened between the crucifiction and that moment? What event could've possibly
driven away the fear Peter had of suffering, as Tacitus put it, the extreme penalty? What would it have taken for you?
Again, Luke gives us an answer from his investigations, this time from his historical document detailing the life of Jesus
that we call the book of Luke.

`Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and MAry the mother of James and the other women
with them who told these things to the apostles, but these words seemed to them an idle tale,
and they did not believe them - Luke 24:10-11 ESV`

So Luke documents that some women told the disciples that the body of Jesus was gone and that
they were told he had been raised from the dead. The disciples reacted pretty much as you or I would, they
didn't believe them. It's worth noting too that it lends a lot of credibility to the story that Luke documents
that it was women who discovered the missing body. You see, in those times, a woman's word wasn't even admissable
in any legal proceeding. Therefore, the only reason to document that women were the first to see the empty tomb
was if it was true, since it would've actually hurt the story in those days. Luke continues:

`But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves,
and he went home marvelling at what had happened - Luke 24:12 ESV`

So Peter confirmed the story of the women, that the body was indeed gone, but he still didn't know what
to think about it. Even faced with an empty tomb, his first thought wasn't "resurrection", for the same reason
it wouldn't have been the first though of you or me. Outside of a zombie movie dead people usually stay dead.
But back to the story, what does Luke tell us finally convinced Peter and the other discples that Jesus really
did rise from the dead?

`As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace to you!"
But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. And he said to them, "Why are you troubled,
and why do doubts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For
a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." And when he had said this,
he showed them his hands and his feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them,
"Have you anything here to eat?" They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate before them. - Luke 24:36-43`

Well that would do it for me. It was clearly enough for Peter too. After that moment we see him give sermon after sermon
telling all who would listen that Jesus was alive and all they had to do was trust in Him to have eternal life. History tells
us that Peter eventually ended up in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero. It was there that he was improsoned and tortured
in the Mamertine prison for 9 months before his execution by crucification, church tradition says he was crucified upside down
at his own request because he said he wasn't worthy to die in the same position as his Lord Jesus. We really can't comprehend
what he went to in those nine months leading up to his execution by the Romans. The Mamertine prison is on the short list for
"worst dungeon of all time". It was two large stone rooms stacked on top of each other. The lower chamber was the death chamber.
The only was in was a hatch in the floor of the upper chamber, light was never let in and it was never cleaned. People were thrown
in there to die slowly from the smell and poisonous air of the chamber. The upper chamber was used to imprison and torture people
prior to trial or execution. Peter was bound upright against a pillar for 9 months, never allowed to sit. Despite all that, and
even in the face of execution, he never recanted his story. He never shouted to anyone "we made it all up! Let me go and I'll tell
everyone!" It's not known for certain of course that the Romans would've taken him up on that if he did offer, but recall what Tacitus
said, that followers of Jesus were hated by the populace. It would've been one more way for the Romans to torture Christians, to have
someone who everyone knew actually knew Jesus, to say that it was all a lie. But he never did, Peter endured what for us is
unimaginable pain and suffering, and a gruesome execution, and to his last breath he proclaimed a risen Lord and Savior who died, not
for the Jews, but for the whole world.

# YOU
So what next? What do you do with this information? Peter's life has been thoughly documented and, along with Paul, is the early
church leader and Apostle we know the most about. There's no evidence to indicate he was crazy, and he was perhaps THE PERSON, above
anyone, who would know for sure if the resurrection is a historical event. He was brash and impetuous when Jesus was alive, he was scared
out of his mind when Jesus was crucified, and he was bold and confident in both his salvation and, if you want it, yours, at the hands
of a man he saw die and then had breakfast with. Peter gladly endured torture and eventual execution at the hands of the Romans. But don't
miss this, he didn't die for what he BELIEVED happened. People do that all the time, but Peter died for what he SAW happen, and what he
saw was so extraordinary that he couldn't stop talking about it, even to save his own life. Maybe he was crazy, there's no evidence
to support that but it's possible. Maybe he was just committed to maintaining the lie for reasons we don't know. Or maybe he watched
his friend and teacher die a terrible death, and then had that same friend ask him for a piece of fish and eat it in front of him. Peter
died for what he saw, how much faith does that take?

# WE
That's enough for me my friends. I'm not a follower of Jesus because the bible tells me I should be, I'm a follower of Jesus because
the events documented in the letters and journals that were eventually put together into what we call the New Testament actually happened.
Jesus of Nazareth is alive, and that demands a response from everyone. My hope is that you won't delay, but that you'll look anew
at evidence you have perhaps heard and dismissed. That you'll reach out to that one friend you have who has constantly been trying
to tell you the same thing Peter died telling the world, Maybe you'll pick up that book that someone gave you years ago hoping
you'll read. Or maybe your next action is the same thing mine was at the age of 27, to for the first time in a long time step into
a church and find people who are willing to walk with you while you search for the truth of who Jesus is, and what he can do in your life,
if you'll only let him. Let me pray for you.
