# Apostles
## Peter
1. Leader of the early church (St. Peter for those with Catholic background)
 * Pre and Post resurrection was basically the frontman for the Apostles

    `But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them:
    "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and 
    give ear to my words" Acts 2:14 ESV, opening of Peter's sermon at Pentecost`

2. First man to investigate the tomb of Jesus

   Relevant because in those times the testimony of women were not admissable
   in any legal proceeding, making the story of the women being the first people
   to see the empty tomb much more credible. The disciples and Luke would've felt
   very awkward admitting that and it didn't help them sell the story to anyone
   else.
   `Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the
   other women with them who told these things to the apostles, but these words
   seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose
   and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves;
   and he went home marveling at what had happened. Luke 24:10-12 ESV`

3. If anyone would know what really happened that first Easter morning, it was Peter
4. Believed to have left Jerusalem by AD 44 (McBirnie, 2004)
5. Imprisoned in Rome in the Mamertine for NINE MONTHS (McBirnie, 2004)

   The Mamertine, also called the Gemonium or the Tullian Keep, is leading the race
   for the title of most horrible dungeon of all time. It is a deep hole cut into solid
   rock out of which two chambers were fashioned, one on top of the other. The only entrance
   was an aperture in the ceiling. The lower chamber was the death chamber, light never entered
   and it was NEVER cleaned. The smell and filth generated a poison that killed anyone thrown
   into it. The upper chamber was the torture chamber. It was here that Peter was chained to a post
   and tortured for nine months. He was chained to the post in an upright position and never allowed
   to sit down. And of course he wasn't alone, he also had to endure being witness
   to the torture and deaths of others while he was there. How he not only survived but
   kept his sanity is beyond our imagination. Yet while he was imprisoned he converted his jailers
   and forty-seven others (McBirnie, 2004)

6. After his imprisonment, Peter was martyred by crucification, tradition says upside down at his own request

   Peter said he was unworthy to die in the same position as his Lord, so the Romans inverted him to the
   delight of the public.
